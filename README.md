## Scenario-based-questions
  * Here’s a situation- You receive the following email from the help desk:
    Dear XYZ Email user,
    To create space for more users we’re deleting all inactive email accounts. Here’s what you have to send to save your account from getting deleted:
    Name (first and last):
    Email Login:
    Password:
    Date of birth:
    Alternate email
    If we don’t receive the above information from you by the end of the week, your email account will be terminated.
    ### If you’re a user what do you do? Justify your answer.
    This email is a classic example of “phishing” – trying to trick you into “biting”. The justification is the generalized way of addressing the receiver which is used in mass     spam emails.Above that, a corporate company will never ask for personal details on mail.They want your information. Don’t respond to email, instant messages (IM),   
    texts,phone calls, etc., asking you for your password or other private information.You should never disclose your password to anyone, even if they say they work for UCSC,   
    ITS, or  other campus organizations.
